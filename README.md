### Comments

Nice little project, vague enough to cause trouble increasing scope too far haha. I kept it simple to only take up a few hours and complete the required features. I considered connecting a backend (potentially storing user playlists and using live data) and containerizing, but that would be too much friction for a simple setup/simple app. I also considered using [react-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player) to play youtube videos of the playlist - but removed it as it didn't quite fit aesthetically with the website. I see the benefit of using redux (or another state management tool), however without much past experience with it (and the additional time to boiler plate it out), I decided not to use it. No easter eggs or anything special. Thanks for the consideration!
