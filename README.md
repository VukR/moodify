# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/components/)

## Requirements

The app was created with `node v18.17.1` and `npm 6.14.4`

### Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repo to a local directory
2. cd into the `moodify` project directory
3. `npm install` to install depdencies
4. `npm start` to launch the application - will use default port 3000, otherwise will ask you to switch ports and automatically handle it for you.

### Comments

Nice little project, vague enough to cause trouble increasing scope too far haha. I kept it simple to only take up a few hours and complete the required features. I considered connecting a backend (potentially storing user playlists and using live data) and containerizing, but that would be too much friction for a simple setup/simple app. I also considered using [react-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player) to play youtube videos of the playlist - but removed it as it didn't quite fit aesthetically with the website. I see the benefit of using redux (or another state management tool), however without much past experience with it (and the additional time to boiler plate it out), I decided not to use it. No easter eggs or anything special. Thanks for the consideration!
